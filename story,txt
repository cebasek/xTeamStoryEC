In a land far far away, lived a girl named Emily who was working on her Binary Search Tree and AVL computer science project all day. Discouraged after the failure of her junit tests, she decided to go to fresh market to buy some ice cream.

But which flavor to choose? There were so many options. In the end Emily chose a classic, mint chocolate chip.

But to her distaste, they recetly ran out of such a perfect flavor. Now the second of the failures of the day, she decided to go bland and accept defeat. She orders vinilla in a dish, the most plain falvor available.
